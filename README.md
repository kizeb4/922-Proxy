## 922 Proxy Reviews

922 Proxy has received mixed feedback from users across various review platforms, reflecting both strengths and areas for improvement in their service delivery.

**Positive User Experiences:**

Many users highlight the extensive IP pool and global coverage as major advantages. Reviews on platforms like AffMaven and Blackdown praise the service's lightning-fast speeds and intuitive user interface. One long-term user noted their residential proxies provide "unparalleled anonymity online" with speeds that significantly enhance business operations. The competitive pricing structure, particularly for bulk purchases, receives consistent appreciation from cost-conscious users.

The platform's compatibility across multiple operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, Android, Linux) and seamless integration with anti-detection browsers and automation tools earns positive mentions. Business users particularly value the CDKey allocation system that allows for flexible account management and reselling opportunities.

**Critical Feedback:**

Recent reviews on Trustpilot present a more nuanced picture, with a mixed rating of approximately 2.9-3.2 out of 5 stars. Some users report issues with IP quality, noting that certain proxies become flagged or blocked on strict platforms. Connection stability concerns include occasional timeouts and session interruptions during automated tasks.

Customer support responsiveness appears as a recurring point of criticism, with some users describing delayed response times and generic replies to technical inquiries. A segment of users on platforms like RapidSeedbox and Scrapeless have raised concerns about IP sourcing practices and the actual availability of advertised IPs.

**Performance Assessment:**

According to DiCloak and other technical reviews, 922 Proxy delivers on its core promises for most standard use cases including web scraping, market research, and social media management. The service performs adequately for geo-targeting requirements with its country, state, and city-level targeting capabilities.

However, power users engaged in high-stakes operations like sneaker copping or accessing heavily protected platforms report higher failure rates compared to premium competitors. The 99.9% uptime claim is challenged by some real-world user experiences, though the majority of users confirm satisfactory availability for business-critical operations.

**Industry Recognition:**

922 Proxy has been featured in articles on platforms like Yahoo Finance and PR Newswire as a notable player in the residential proxy market. The service's extensive IP pool and competitive pricing position it as a viable option for small to medium-sized businesses, though enterprise clients may require more robust solutions.

The platform maintains partnerships with over 800 third-party tools including popular anti-detection browsers like AdsPower, Dolphin{anty}, MoreLogin, and VMLogin, demonstrating market acceptance within the proxy ecosystem.

**Overall Verdict:**

922 Proxy serves as a functional mid-tier proxy solution suitable for users prioritizing affordability and scale over premium support and guaranteed IP quality. It works well for standard web scraping, data collection, and market research tasks but may face challenges with platforms employing sophisticated anti-proxy measures.
